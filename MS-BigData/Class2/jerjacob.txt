-----------------
-- Q1. Create a Hive table “nyc_taxi_Jan” for the NYC Yellow Taxi Data (January 2014). Load all the yellow taxi January 2014 data into the nyc_taxi_Jan table
-----------------
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS nyc_taxi_Jan(vendor_id String,pickup_datetime timestamp,dropoff_datetime timestamp,passenger_count int,trip_distance double,pickup_longitude double,pickup_latitude double,rate_code int,store_and_fwd_flag char(1),dropoff_longitude double,dropoff_latitude double,payment_type CHAR(3),fare_amount double,surcharge double,mta_tax double,tip_amount double,tolls_amount double,total_amount double) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STORED AS TEXTFILE tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="2");

Load data local inpath "yellow_tripdata_2014-01.csv" into table nyc_taxi_Jan;

-----------------
-- Q2. Write a HiveQL query to show the top 10 longest trips in the nyc_taxi_Jan table. Show all the columns. Sort the results by distance in descending order
-----------------
select * from nyc_taxi_jan order by trip_distance desc limit 10;

-----------------
-- Q3. The drop-off/pick-up area of the LaGuardia Airport is between latitudes [40.766703, 40.774724] and longitudes [-73.877101, -73.859692]. Write a Hive query to find the total number of passengers picked up by yellow taxi at this airport during each hour of day (0 ~ 23) in the whole month. Sort the rows by hour in ascending order
-----------------
select hour(pickup_datetime) as hourofday, sum(passenger_count) as passengers
from nyc_taxi_jan 
where pickup_latitude between 40.766703 and 40.774724
and pickup_longitude between -73.877101 and -73.859692
group by hour(pickup_datetime) 
order by hourofday;
